# Free Rich Education for Everyone (FREE)

## Introduction

Not everyone can afford expensive IT courses or university programs. Fortunately, computer science and IT skills can be learned for free through world-class online resources. Beginners often don’t know where to start, so I’m bringing the most reliable and high-quality learning materials together in one place.

## CSE curriculum

Follow these resources in order:

[1. MIT missing semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)

Classes teach you all about advanced topics within CS, from operating systems to machine learning, but there’s one critical subject that’s rarely covered, and is instead left to students to figure out on their own: proficiency with their tools. MIT missing semester will teach you how to master the command-line, use a powerful text editor, use fancy features of version control systems, and much more!

[2. Harvard CS50](https://www.edx.org/cs50)

Harvard University's Computer Science 50 program, or CS50, is a collection of introductory computer science courses designed for students at all levels who want to learn foundational and advanced computing concepts.

[3. OSSU computer science curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)

**Open Source Society University is a community of students of all levels, completing a comprehensive, project based, open-source computer science curriculum, helping each other and sharing their experiences and code through github and community forums.**

### Miscellaneous

[2. Ebook resource for any language](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books?tab=readme-ov-file&fbclid=IwVERTSAO8nYJleHRuA2FlbQIxMABzcnRjBmFwcF9pZAwzNTA2ODU1MzE3MjgAAR7acYS1KYD8nk7bH1QWqBCzDfVvjDGkq_4IDMa2oPGR4sK1MMESEVbePdu0Ew_aem_QaFlarbVCvIEv3L9h50ffw)

## Web development

**To understand web development, you should learn at least the basics of the backend if you want to be an expert in frontend, and vice versa. Also, the 0th course is necessary to understand the basics of computer science to implement it in the development. And I've added some behind-the-scenes details of how some of these technologies work, because it'll give you an idea from the engineering point of view.**
